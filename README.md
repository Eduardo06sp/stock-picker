# stock-picker

In this project, I impelemented a stock_picker method that takes an array of prices. Each value represents a day.

This method returns an array representing the best day to buy, then the best day to sell, respectively.

Among the apparently required skills to implement such functionality, I learned:

* To nest loops in order to test every combination possible

* Write clear variable names that accurately reflect their content

* Write a method that can easily be expanded to take user input (avoided doing so for the convenience of running preset values versus inputting them every time)

* Planning a solution on paper prior to coding to minimize mental blocks and conjure a solution more quickly
